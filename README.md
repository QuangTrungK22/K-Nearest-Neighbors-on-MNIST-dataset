#  K-Nearest Neighbors on MNIST Dataset

##  Overview
The **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm is implemented on the **MNIST dataset** using **C++**, a widely recognized collection of **handwritten digit images** (0-9). This project aims to classify digits by comparing them to the most similar training examples, using a **distance-based voting mechanism** to determine the final label.

##  Features
-  **MNIST Dataset**: Consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits.
-  **C++ Implementation**: Built from scratch with efficient data structures and algorithms.
-  **KNN Algorithm**: Classifies digits by measuring distances to the nearest neighbors.
-  **Performance**: Optimized for speed and memory usage in C++.
-  **Evaluation**: Measures accuracy and performance on the test set.

##  How It Works
1. **Load Data**: Parse and preprocess the MNIST images and labels.
2. **Choose k**: Select the number of nearest neighbors for classification.
3. **Distance Calculation**: Compute distances (e.g., **Euclidean distance**) between test and training points.
4. **Vote**: Neighbors cast votes for their respective labels.
5. **Predict**: Assign the most common label to the test image based on the votes.

##  Requirements
- **C++ Compiler** (GCC, Clang, MSVC, etc.)
- **CMake** (Optional, for project building)
- **Libraries**: STL (Standard Template Library), optional libraries for matrix operations like Eigen or OpenCV (if needed)

##  Results
- **Accuracy**: Achieves strong classification performance on the MNIST test set.
- **Flexibility**: Allows tuning of `k` and distance metrics for optimization.
- **Efficiency**: Leverages C++ capabilities for fast computation and memory management.

##  Usage
```bash
# Compile the program
g++ knn_mnist.cpp -o knn_mnist

# Run the program
./knn_mnist
```

##  Future Improvements
-  Support for different distance metrics (Manhattan, Minkowski, etc.)
-  Parallelization for faster distance computation
-  Hyperparameter tuning for optimal `k`
-  Visualizations of classification results
